                <p>The combat of Monster Hunter is like jazz. Keeping up with the other players, 
                    swaying with the melody and following their beat, and when you find an oppertunity, swinging in and taking control of the melody. 
                    If you're good enough, you could even lead the song the whole way through.</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p>Where you stand in relation to the monster is a great descider for whether 
                    or not you get hit, or how many whacks you can get in before the monster can retaliate.</p>
                <p>Stand too close, and you'll get hit. Stand too far, and you won't be able to attack. 
                    Stand in the monster's face, and you won't be able to react to the inevitable insta-charge. 
                    Try to stand too far behind the monster, and you'll spend more time chasing tail than Johnny Bravo.</p>
                <p>Even when you find a sweet-spot that allows you to attack and not get hit back, it might not work against every monster.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So, what do you do? You could throw yourself at one specific type of monster over and over 
                    until you start responding to attacks and situations as automatically as Pavlov's Dog does to the sound of a bell, 
                    but fight another type of monster, and you'll have to start all over again. 
                    This way is like learning to play a song on the piano, except you can't read sheet music 
                    and your teacher refuses to give any guidance aside from screeching whenever you play the wrong note before stending you flying across the room.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This blog will not be able to stop your piano instructor from breathing fire on you, 
                    but it does aim to teach you how to read that sheet music so you aren't flying blind.</p>

            <h2 class="paper">Concept #1: Angle</h1> <!--match title background to paragraph background-->
            <article>
                <img src="img/angle_thumbnail.png" class="dynimage">
                <p class="patch">Your angle in relation to the front of the monster is perhaps the most important variable that you need to consider. <br><br>
                    In most situations, you want to keep yourself at 1 to 2 o'clock from where the monster is facing. 
                    This angle allows you to attack the head (usually the weakest point) and force the monster to 
                    spend time turning towards you, which gives you enough time to respond or nail its head with a strong attack. 
                    Just remember to get back into 1-2 o'clock after the turn.</p>

            <h2 class="paper">Concept #2: Distance</h1> <!--replace 'concept #'-->
            <p class="patch">As your distance from the monster increases, so does the amount of time you have to react to its next attack. 
                Manage your distance from the monster so you are close enough to attack with your weapon at a moment's notice, while staying far enough to avoid getting trampled. <br><br>
                However, not all weapons are created equal. 
                Some weapons, like the aptly named longsword, have a longer reach than others by virtue of the sheer length of the weapon. 
                This stands in contrast to weapons like the dual blades, which have very short attacks. <br><br>
                However, simple weapon size is not the only determining factor to its effective range. For example, the Greatsword has large attacks, 
                but its so slow that most users prefer to keep it sheathed while they reposition. On the other hand, 
                Dual Blades are very short, but their high speed and access to multiple lunging moves allows them to exploit small oppertunities.<br><br>
                Lastly, the Bow and Bowguns are ranged weapons that don't need to stay close to do damage. 
                However, the shots they fire are affected by a mechanic called "critical range", where being at a certain distance will make your attacks stronger.
                The exact distance is variable, depending on many factors like what sort of arrow coating or ammunition you are using. </p>
