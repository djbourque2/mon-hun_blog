                <h1>PREFACE</h1>
                
                <p>The combat of Monster Hunter is like jazz. Keeping up with the other players, 
                    swaying with the melody and following their beat, and when you find an oppertunity, swinging in and taking control of the melody. 
                    If you're good enough, you could even lead the song the whole way through.</p>
                <p></p>
                <br>
                <p>Where you stand in relation to the monster is a great descider for whether 
                    or not you get hit, or how many whacks you can get in before the monster can retaliate.</p>
                <p>Stand too close, and you'll get hit. Stand too far, and you won't be able to attack. 
                    Stand in the monster's face, and you won't be able to react to the inevitable insta-charge. 
                    Try to stand too far behind the monster, and you'll spend more time chasing tail than Johnny Bravo.</p>
                <p>Even when you find a sweet-spot that allows you to attack and not get hit back, it might not work against every monster.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So, what do you do? You could throw yourself at one specific type of monster over and over 
                    until you start responding to attacks and situations as automatically as Pavlov's Dog does to the sound of a bell, 
                    but fight another type of monster, and you'll have to start all over again. 
                    This way is like learning to play a song on the piano, except you can't read sheet music 
                    and your teacher refuses to give any guidance aside from screeching whenever you play the wrong note before stending you flying across the room.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This blog will not be able to stop your piano instructor from breathing fire on you, 
                    but it does aim to teach you how to read that sheet music so you aren't flying blind.</p>

                <img src="img/angle_thumbnail.png" class="dynimage">
                <p>Your angle in relation to the front of the monster is perhaps the most important variable that you need to consider.</p>

            <h1>Concept #2: Distance</h1>
            <p>As your distance from the monster increases, so does the amount of time you have to react to its next attack.</p>
