                <h2>Walking.</h2>
                <p>Simple, elegant, and effective. Assuming you have positioned yourself well, many attacks can be avoided simply by walking out of the way, without need to sheathe your weapons for a sprint. Unlike other means of evasion, walking has no commitment, and thus has the greatest potential for counter-attacks. </p>
                <br>
                <p>If you have the opportunity to evade by walking to the side or towards the monster, do so. However, if the only way to walk out of an attack results in the ceding of ground, such as walking away from the monster to move out of range, the time you bought yourself from walking may be lost trying to re-approach.</p>
