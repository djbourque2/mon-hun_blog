                    <h2>Walking.</h2>
                    <p>Simple, elegant, and effective. Assuming you have positioned yourself well, many attacks can be avoided simply by walking out of the way, without need to sheathe your weapons for a sprint. Unlike other means of evasion, walking has no commitment, and thus has the greatest potential for counter-attacks. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you have the opportunity to evade by walking to the side or towards the monster, do so. However, if the only way to walk out of an attack results in the ceding of ground, such as walking away from the monster to move out of range, the time you bought yourself from walking may be lost trying to re-approach.</p>

                    <h2>Dodging.</h2>
                    <p>The bread and butter of your defensive positioning. For most weapons, dodging results in your character rolling forward with a short burst of speed. On others, dodging becomes a short hop forward. On the Lance and Gunlance, they too use this hop, although they can only move backwards with it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The main advantage to dodging is that it can be used to interrupt the follow-through of your attacks to quickly reposition yourself. While short, the speed at which you move while dodging is faster than any other means of repositioning yourself, therefore it is excellent at quickly moving short distances. However, during the latter half of a dodge, you stay in place and cannot act immediately. This in addition to its limited range means it is impractical as a means of covering larger distances.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Dodge when you need to be a meter and a half away from where you are right now ASAP.</p>

                    <h2>Running.</h2>
                    <p>When walking won't allow you to outmaneuver your foe, consider sheathing your weapon before sprinting. While running, you move considerably faster than when you have your weapon out, and can maneuver around attacks with greater ease. However, sheathing your weapon takes time, and attacking while running will unsheathe your weapon, making you have to sheathe it again if you want to continue running.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, running for too long can deplete your stamina, resulting in your character being forced to catch their breath, leaving them wide open for an attack.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Consider running if you anticipate an extremely difficult to avoid attack, or if there is a great enough distance to justify putting your weapon away to close the distance faster.</p>

                    <h2>Dodging with i-Frames.</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you dodge, there is a brief window at the start in which you are completely invincible. While difficult to time, you can use this invulnerable frame of time to phase through attacks, looking as if you had rolled through them. 
                        Theoretically, you can dodge anything with this technique, but some attacks can outlast the duration of invincibility and hit you even if you timed the dodge perfectly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While risky, the payoff of using i-frames effectively is tremendous, allowing you to avoid large sweeping attacks while moving towards the monster, putting yourself in an excellent position to counterattack. 
                        However, just because you can time a roll to evade an attack doesn't mean it's always the best thing to do. 
                        Sometimes it is better to simply walk out of the way of an attack rather than roll through it, either because rolling would put yourself into an unfavorable position, or because the risk of messing up the timing eclipses the potential benefit of succeeding.
                        Additionally, it should be mentioned that because i-framing an attack feels so satisfying, it can skew your perception of what option is the best to use in any given situation.

                    <h2>Taking the Hit.</h2>
                    <p>This isn't so much a surefire method of avoiding an attack as it is minimizing the damage you would take.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some attacks have multiple different parts of the attack, such as the hit from the jaws of a monster and the hit from the shifting of their legs as they lung forward. If you do not have confidence that you can avoid both parts of that single attack, but you can choose which part you do get hit by, then you can opt to take the hit from the lower-damaging leg shift.
                        
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is possible because in almost every situation, getting hit and being put into an animation where you have no control of your character will make you invulnerable until you regain control, also know as when you "wake up".</p>

                    <h2>Superman Dive.</h2>
                    <p>A technique that can only be used while running away from a monster with your weapon sheathed. Dodging while running away will cause your character to dive a long distance forward, landing on their belly before scrambling to their feet. While airborne during the dive, you are completely invulnerable, much as you are during an i-frame dodge. However, the amount of time you are invincible during a dive is much, much longer, being able to outlast nearly any attack.

                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Given that the Superman Dive can only be used while running directly away from the monster with your weapon sheathed, and that the time it takes to regain your footing is uncomfortably long, this is a desperation maneuver, to be used as a last resort. In exchange for guaranteeing evasion, you often recover so late that the monster is sometimes able to begin another attack as you are getting up. Use in response to an attack against which no other options will consistently work.

                    <h2>Blocking.</h2>
                    <p>Some Weapons are able to guard attacks, taking only a fraction of the damage (sometimes nagating the attack entirely) and recovering much faster than getting hit.
                        Guarding is advantageous because it allows you to withstand an attack and maintain your position, and requires little effort or commitment on your part to pull off compared to other evasive options.
                        All you need to do is hold your shield up when you think you might get hit, and resume attacking when you think you're safe.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, blocking is not almighty. 
                        Guarding an attack still damages you, and overtime that damage will add up. 
                        Addtionally, guarding attacks will drain your stamina, and if you don't have enough stamina to withstand an attack, you will still get hit, regardless of whether you blocked it or not.
                        Furthermore, some attacks will ignore your guard completely, requiring either investment into equipment that allows you to block these unblockable attacks, or to adjust your positioning to be able to respond to these attacks.
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, not all guards are created equal. The blocking ability of a Lance is far superior to that of a Greatsword. 
                        This is because blocking an attack with a weapon with a powerful block like the Lance will deal much less damage to the user and allow the user to retaliate much faster than someone blocking with a weapon with a weaker guard like the Greatsword.
                        Greatswords, and in general weapons that use the weapon itself and not a shield to guard, will also become dull if they block too many attacks, requiring maintenance after guarding.
                        This disparity is because weapons with stronger guarding capabilities need to rely on their ability to block more than other weapons, as their movespeed and dodges are generally slower and less evasive than other weapons.

                    <h2>Perfect Parries/Evasions.</h2>
                    <p>Other weapons have abilities that allow them to "parry" an attack, either granting immunity to knockbacks, triggering an animation during which your character is comepletely invulnerable, or negating the attack entirely. 
                        They work by following a similar logic to i-frame evades, as syncing their "parry" timing to occur when the monster attacks will cause the parry to activate, and much like i-frame evades, they are very satisfying to pull off.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unlike i-frame dodges, parries are much easier to use, but failure to successfully pull them off can put the user in danger, as the lengthy recovery time could spell their doom</p>
