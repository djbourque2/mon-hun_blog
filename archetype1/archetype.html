                    <h2>Walking.</h2>
                    <p>Simple, elegant, and effective. Assuming you have positioned yourself well, many attacks can be avoided simply by walking out of the way, without need to sheathe your weapons for a sprint. Unlike other means of evasion, walking has no commitment, and thus has the greatest potential for counter-attacks. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you have the opportunity to evade by walking to the side or towards the monster, do so. However, if the only way to walk out of an attack results in the ceding of ground, such as walking away from the monster to move out of range, the time you bought yourself from walking may be lost trying to re-approach.</p>

                    <h2>Dodging.</h2>
                    <p>The bread and butter of your defensive positioning. For most weapons, dodging results in your character rolling forward with a short burst of speed. On others, dodging becomes a short hop forward. On the Lance and Gunlance, they too use this hop, although they can only move backwards with it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The main advantage to dodging is that it can be used to interrupt the follow-through of your attacks to quickly reposition yourself. While short, the speed at which you move while dodging is faster than any other means of repositioning yourself, therefore it is excellent at quickly moving short distances. However, during the latter half of a dodge, you stay in place and cannot act immediately. This in addition to its limited range means it is impractical as a means of covering larger distances.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Dodge when you need to be a meter and a half away from where you are right now ASAP.</p>

                    <h2>Running.</h2>
                    <p>When walking won't allow you to outmaneuver your foe, consider sheathing your weapon before sprinting. While running, you move considerably faster than when you have your weapon out, and can maneuver around attacks with greater ease. However, sheathing your weapon takes time, and attacking while running will unsheathe your weapon, making you have to sheathe it again if you want to continue running.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, running for too long can deplete your stamina, resulting in your character being forced to catch their breath, leaving them wide open for an attack.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Consider running if you anticipate an extremely difficult to avoid attack, or if there is a great enough distance to justify putting your weapon away to close the distance faster.</p>

                    <h2>Dodging with i-Frames.</h2>
                    <p>When you dodge, there is a brief window at the start in which you are completely invincible. While difficult to time, you can use this invulnerable frame of time to phase through attacks, looking as if you had rolled through them. Theoretically, you can dodge anything with this technique, but some attacks can outlast the duration of invincibility and hit you even if you timed the dodge perfectly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While risky, the payoff of using i-frames effectively is tremendous, allowing you to avoid large sweeping attacks while moving towards the monster, putting yourself in an excellent position to counterattack.</p>

                    <h2>Superman Dive.</h2>
                    <p>A technique that can only be used while running away from a monster with your weapon sheathed. Dodging while running away will cause your character to dive a long distance forward, landing on their belly before scrambling to their feet. While airborne during the dive, you are completely invulnerable, much as you are during an i-frame dodge. However, the amount of time you are invincible during a dive is much, much longer, being able to outlast nearly any attack.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Given that the Superman Dive can only be used while running directly away from the monster with your weapon sheathed, and that the time it takes to regain your footing is uncomfortably long, this is a desperation maneuver, to be used as a last resort. In exchange for guaranteeing evasion, you often recover so late that the monster is sometimes able to begin another attack as you are getting up. Use in response to an attack against which no other options will consistently work.</p>
